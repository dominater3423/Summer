        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <p>The class was flawed from the start. I don't know who though it was a good idea to have an eight week class in two week intervals. Nevertheless I did improve my HTML, CSS, and, surprisingly, photo editing as a result of this class. Also, learned that our school provides with the pro version of GitHub pages, that's nice I guess. I'm getting kind of tired of images that serve no purpose, remember reclusive luddite here, joking calm down.</p>
        <p>I should really watch more carefully what I say. People don't understand when I'm talking in a satirical manner. Another thing that I need to stop doing is probably just limit the amount of people I talk to online because I can't help myself when I'm just sitting behind a keyboard. I don't know why but I find it fun getting into arguments online, I guess that's the culture that I grew up in.</p>
        <p>Another thing I noticed about myself is that whenever I send emails I write them mostly for myself then send it to somebody as an afterthought. Working on consciously not doing that.</p>
        <p>Since there isn't much on this page here is a picture, think I'll put like a narwhal or something.</p>
