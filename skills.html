        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>Seriously, I've had so much work today. Can somebody please tell these teachers that creating websites and these POLs takes time, at least if the quality is going to be anywhere near decent. Today we got assigned that as well as adding to our portfolios. I know I could've half-assed it and get off fine, but I actually had a decent idea for the POL. Learned to use blender's video editor today as well. It's quite powerful, and pretty easy to use once you get used to it. The main thing is learning to use keyframes, their key, ha. Video editing takes time though. You have to get the media itself, edit, render, and finally upload. That is quite a lengthy process! At least give us two, maybe three, days to do this.</p>
        <h3>Middle School</h3>
        <p>When I was in middle school I had this funny idea that I wanted to become a developer, mostly by being exposed to /g/. Dumb kid I was! Still a kid Dominic. I know, I know. Anyway I think I came across Linux sometime in seventh grade. That got me interested in computers, and you know a year and a half later I was running Gentoo. I used to distrohop but then I realized what distro your on really doesn't make that big of a difference. During that time I was still more "normal," so I didn't devote too much time to it; mostly because back then I had the attention span of a rodent, thanks internet. I gradually pulled myself out of the viscous sequence, but don't know whether I'm better off for it. I maybe process stuff faster and I've acquired a few, maybe?, useless skills; I'm really not all that much happier for it though. My render is done! Uploaded it to youtube, don't know whether it was worth all day completing though. At least I learned something new I guess. Youtube link is <a href="here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC7nd_k2VHo&feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Watched it again, actually quite like it; maybe I am just a tad bias. Anyway for previous skills I got gotten most of them from my tinkering around with Linux, that is computer skills. I took some computer science classes in middle school, but honestly they were worst than useless. This means I knew the basics of programming, was combfortable in the shell, and knew where to find decent resources.</p>
        <p>Sorry, don't feel like devoting all that much effort on this today. Still have to finish my portfolio. ;(</p>
