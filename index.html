        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>The two main reasons I decided to sign up for this class was that I enjoy working with computers and needed my VAPA credits. The truth is I totally loathe computers and if I had the choice I'd, no that's not entirely the truth. It's the same as it's ever been with me. I love the technology, I loathe its users; it's hard to emphasize how much for the latter. People are such bloody morons, it's incredible. There are two sides of this, one I feel that someone needs to say something, on the other hand I'm so tired of shouting into a void that nobody hears. It's a lost cause. The only sane way to live in this world, if your someone remotely like me, is to toil for yourself and let the world be damned. We humans aren't worthy of geniuses, not that I'm calling myself one.</p>
        <p>Should I go into detail about what I didn't like? I do so much complaining about this school, I'm sort of tired of it. I wonder if I'd be happier elsewhere, who knows. What I really want is to get out of the public school system. It really is a tragedy that any decently sized country is condemned to have a lackluster public education system. I try to laugh at it and try not to take it seriously, but I don't know whether it makes it any better. </p>
        <p>I failed my photography class so this was necessary for me to take, unless I wanted to take it again next year. It's funny how this counts as the same credits as a year long class, I mean that just goes to show nobody really cares about learning everything its just for credits and a financial future. Sigh.</p>
        <h3>What I Expected</h3>
        <p>Well what I can tell you is that I expected more instruction. All I learned in this class I essentially taught myself. Also, can't say I learned terribly much. My websites have improved, but not as substantially as they could've. Having assignments where we had to create a drop down would've been nice. Or maybe teaching us the basics of JavaScript so we can add additional functionality to our websites. How about days solely devoted to CSS? No, none of these I got. In it's stead we were just handed assignment after assignment of creating some generic website.</p>
        <h3>People</h3>
        <p>Think class has sufficiently showed me the crowd that computer science attracts and why I need to run as far as possible from it. Wonder if the humanities are just as bad these days. I was looking at an Ethics textbook used at a CSM class and I was dumbfounded. Now what you'd think you'd find in an Ethics textbook is the basics of the various ethical theories and debates, well what you got here was the "ethics" of abortion and various other neoliberal political horses. Along with that the book was very short, not more than four hundred pages. It's depressing. This year seems to be one of those years where everything could go wrong has. What a crappy year, coronavirus, civil unrest, mass protests, complete dismissal of freedoms, Trump and Biden for the whitehouse, mass unemployment, justifying complete invasion of privacy because of the virus, etc.; I'm becoming increasingly sympathetic of oligarchies. Watching the complete stupidity of the way people have reacted to all of this, I don't know. You know why I "backed" Trump, it's because he pisses off so many people I've come to despise. That just goes to show the point I'm at with American politics.</p>
        <p>I don't know what's worse, a slow, peaceful death or a glorious, violent one. The former is probably better, but it hurts in a more subtle way. Also, I'm tired of everyone attempting to take the moral high ground. These people cause infinitely more trouble than those who don't pretend to. All these protesters, who are they making their point to? I've been told ever since I was a little boy that racism is one of gravest sins, this is a message that has crept to every part of the Western world. They're trying to tell me that America is systematically racist? Can we just deport all these protesters to some petty third world dictatorship or something. It's like holding protests in California about electing Democrats. Just absolutely pointless, just to satisfy their will to power. Another analogy was, I forget the exact details, but they were trying to get all hospitals to provide the means of getting an abortion, even religious ones. Now this is trivial, it is just to spite, dealing a final blow, to a dying breed of people.</p>
        <p>What to do? The only answer is give up. Things aren't going to change for the better, get over it. Start building yourself up instead of wasting that energy on these futile endeavors. Take steps so that you're generally less reliant on the government and less under their jurisdiction, it's better in the long run. Then if you feel you're alone in these matters, it's not true. It is similar to the reason we have philologists. It is based on the hope that some people out their will benefit they way they should from the books, even if their not immediately visible. Stop wasting your time banging your head up against the wall, it's not worth it.</p>
        <p>This has kind of turned into a little rant, sorry.</p>
